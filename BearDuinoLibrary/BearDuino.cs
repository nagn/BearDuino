/*  NOTES:   
 *      This is a simple thread safe (so far as I can tell) singleton class that contains all of the functionality needed to
 * incorporate a speaking teddy bear with proper lip-synching into whatever sort of project you desire.
 * When called from your application you will only need to set a couple of values up front and the bear will speak (through your computer speakers that is) 
 * by calling the Speak method while passing a string of text to be spoken...pretty simple huh?
 * 
 * Need to setup - Before you call the Speak method you will need to:
 *      - Pass a SerialPort into the method. This will be a Serial Port based on the on the COM that your Arduino is attached to and 
 *      should reflect the settings of port with respect to baud rate, parity, start and end bits etc. *Note: should also be the same
 *      Baud rate as the serial port that is created in your Arduino Sketch. By default I am using 9600 for my Examples.
 *      - Pass in the variables for the positions of your particular bears 'standard' mouth and eye positions with the SetBearConstants
 *      method. All bears are not quite created equal and you will therefore need to find and set these positions for proper 
 *      lip-synching to look as good as possible. *Note: you can use the example application to find these values with your bear, write them down
 *      and pass them in as constants in your application.
 *      
 *      Some notes on voices: There is a method for setting your voice and this may be changed at any time and will be reflected the next text that is spoken.
 * The voice name is not necessary and if it is left empty or cannot be resolved your systems default SAPI voice engine will be chosen.
 * When you have other engines installed on your machine you can get the names my looking at my sample applications voice drop down to see how to get a
 * list of these or simply go to the Control Panel and in the 'Accessibility' section there is a place for setting your default voice. The names in 
 * the dropdown would be what you would use there. 
 * 
 *      Some SAPI voices are much better than others but few are as bad as the one provide with Windows XP...do yourself a favor and find another free or cheap one
 * somewhere and try it out instead. The one that comes with Vista, 7 and 8 is much better and works well with the lip-syncing. Some voices that sound really
 * good are still bad for the lip-synching because it relies on the SAPI voice engine developers implementation of the "VisemeReached" event which is what
 * triggers the mouth motion in real time.
 * 
 * Note also there is a method called 'CloseEyes' that can be used to blink the eyes or so forth. Send this method a 'true' and the eyes will close and 'false' will open them.
 * 
 * Have fun and please post cool things that you have done with it!
 * 
 * Cheers!
